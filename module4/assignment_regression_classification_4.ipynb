    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Watch Aaron Gallant's [video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pREaWFli-5I) (12 minutes) & [video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQgVt4hFgY) (9 minutes) to learn about the mathematics of Logistic Regression.\n",
    "- [ ] Do train/validate/test split with the Tanzania Waterpumps data.\n",
    "- [ ] Do one-hot encoding. (Remember it may not work with high cardinality categoricals.)\n",
    "- [ ] Use scikit-learn for logistic regression.\n",
    "- [ ] Get your validation accuracy score.\n",
    "- [ ] Get and plot your coefficients.\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file. Or you can use the Kaggle API to submit your predictions.)\n",
    "- [ ] Commit your notebook to your fork of the GitHub repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Do Not Copy-Paste.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubOw9B3Hfip27hF2ZFnW3a3z9xAgrUDRReOEo-FHCVs/edit) You must type each of these exercises in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doing\n",
    "- [ ] Add your own stretch goal(s) !\n",
    "- [ ] Clean the data. For ideas, refer to [The Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide),  a \"reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.\" One of the issues is [\"Zeros replace missing values.\"](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide#zeros-replace-missing-values)\n",
    "- [ ] Make exploratory visualizations.\n",
    "- [ ] Do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).\n",
    "- [ ] Try [scikit-learn pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the relationships between feature(s) and target. I recommend you do this with your training set, after splitting your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you may want to create a new column to represent the target as a number, 0 or 1. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train['functional'] = (train['status_group']=='functional').astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try [Seaborn \"Categorical estimate\" plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html) for features with reasonably few unique values. (With too many unique values, the plot is unreadable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical features. (If there are too many unique values, you can replace less frequent values with \"OTHER.\")\n",
    "- Numeric features. (If there are too many unique values, you can [bin with pandas cut / qcut functions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/basics.html?highlight=qcut#discretization-and-quantiling).)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try [Seaborn linear model plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/regression.html) with numeric features. For this problem, you may want to use the parameter `logistic=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "You do _not_ need to use Seaborn, but it's nice because it includes confidence intervals to visualize uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High-cardinality categoricals\n",
    "\n",
    "This code from the previous assignment demonstrates how to replace less frequent values with 'OTHER'\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reduce cardinality for NEIGHBORHOOD feature ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get a list of the top 10 neighborhoods\n",
    "top10 = train['NEIGHBORHOOD'].value_counts()[:10].index\n",
    "\n",
    "# At locations where the neighborhood is NOT in the top 10,\n",
    "# replace the neighborhood with 'OTHER'\n",
    "train.loc[~train['NEIGHBORHOOD'].isin(top10), 'NEIGHBORHOOD'] = 'OTHER'\n",
    "test.loc[~test['NEIGHBORHOOD'].isin(top10), 'NEIGHBORHOOD'] = 'OTHER'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scikit-Learn User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html) explains why pipelines are useful, and demonstrates how to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pipeline can be used to chain multiple estimators into one. This is useful as there is often a fixed sequence of steps in processing the data, for example feature selection, normalization and classification. Pipeline serves multiple purposes here:\n",
    "> - **Convenience and encapsulation.** You only have to call fit and predict once on your data to fit a whole sequence of estimators.\n",
    "> - **Joint parameter selection.** You can grid search over parameters of all estimators in the pipeline at once.\n",
    "> - **Safety.** Pipelines help avoid leaking statistics from your test data into the trained model in cross-validation, by ensuring that the same samples are used to train the transformers and predictors.\n",
